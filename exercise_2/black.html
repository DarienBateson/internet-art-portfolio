    <h3>Black Road Not Taken</h3>
    <h4>Robert Frost</h4>
    <p>
        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, <br>
        And sorry I could not travel both <br>
        And be one traveler, long I stood <br>
        And looked down one as far as I could <br>
        To where it bent in the undergrowth; <br> <br>
        
        Then took the other, as just as fair, <br>
        And having perhaps the better claim, <br>
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br>
        Though as for that the passing there <br>
        Had worn them really about the same, <br> <br>
        
        And both that morning equally lay <br>
        In leaves no step had trodden black. <br>
        Oh, I kept the first for another day! <br>
        Yet knowing how way leads on to way, <br>
        I doubted if I should ever come back. <br> <br>
        
        I shall be telling this with a sigh <br>
        Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br>
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” <br>
        I took the one less traveled by, <br>
        And that has made all the difference.
    </p>
